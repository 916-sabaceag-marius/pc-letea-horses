# Proiect Colectiv - Delivery Platform Documentation

## Introduction

**App name** is a dual-sided delivery platform designed to connect customers with a variety of restaurants. The platform serves two primary user types: **Customers** who browse menus and place orders, and **Company Users** who manage their restaurants, menus, and sales.

This documentation outlines the features, user flows, and functional specifications for both sides of the platform.


## User Roles & Access Levels

The platform's functionality is divided based on the user's authentication status and role.

| User Type | Access Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Guest / Customer** | Not Logged In | A user browsing the platform, viewing restaurants, and placing orders. |
| **Authenticated Customer (optional)** | Logged In (Customer) | A registered customer who can access order history and a streamlined checkout. |
